One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.####SERVICE#GENERAL####2
We left, never to return.####RESTAURANT#GENERAL####2
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.####FOOD#PRICES####2

The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.####SERVICE#GENERAL####2

There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.####SERVICE#GENERAL####2
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.####SERVICE#GENERAL####2

Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.####SERVICE#GENERAL####1
