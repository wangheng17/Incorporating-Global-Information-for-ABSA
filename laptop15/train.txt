Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.####SUPPORT#QUALITY####2

A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).####OS#QUALITY####2
A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.####HARD_DISC#QUALITY####2
A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.####MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY####2
Went silently.####MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY####2
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.####LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE####2
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !####MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY####2
And I'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !####LAPTOP#QUALITY####2
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13" in April, and I loved it.####LAPTOP#GENERAL####1
I was so happy with my new Mac.####LAPTOP#GENERAL####2
Then the hard drive failed;####HARD_DISC#QUALITY####2
my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!####LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS####2
So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.####LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE####2
I can't even turn it off.####LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE####2
It's catatonic.####LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE####2
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.####LAPTOP#QUALITY####2
I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.####LAPTOP#QUALITY####2

Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.####LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY####2
After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.####LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY####2

Games being the main issue.####LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS####2
It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.####SOFTWARE#USABILITY####2
Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!####LAPTOP#GENERAL####1
